//Use a FOR loop when you know the amount of times you want it to loop for
//Use WHILE when you need it to continue until the user does something to make it stop/unknown conditions

//LOOPS PRACTICE
//********
//GUIDE TO FOR LOOP**
// for (begin; condition; step) {
//     // ... loop body ...
//   }
// //EXAMPLE**
// //variable i equals 0; as long as i is less than 3 continue the loop; add 1 to i after each loop
// for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { // shows 0, then 1, then 2
//     alert(i);
//   }
// //When loop reaches 2 it will print in console that the "loop is done"
//   console.log(`loop is done`);
